# K_folders
bash Script to categorize your files in folders

This script is very good for categorizing your files in different folders
Usually, for the time you want, you will find many files in the folders named in your files, such as the category for very useful videos.
Default is set to the file in format mkv, but you can use any format like your own photo format or song format.
What the script does is to search between all the current path files to select the files you want and to create a folder with the name of the file and transfer the files to the folders.

(./filefolders)
